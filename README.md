# covid19-exploration-project
Exploration and Visualization of COVID-19 Data across the world

This project uses SQL to explore COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations in different countries. The data I used is updated daily in real time. Queries include finding the highest death count per population, calculating global statistics, and finding a rolling sum of people vaccinated. At the end of the exploration, I create two views for later visualization in Tableau. The first sql file is my inital exploration, and the subsequent files are queries where I take the output and create [Tableau visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/auntiewhnor.kpolie/viz/COVID-19Statistics_16416947284310/Dashboard1).
